# Link List.
`Chrome Extension (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)`

[![Made With Love](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_with-Love%E2%99%A1-pink)]()

Welcome to Link List, my Chrome extension designed to simplify the way you store your favorite links with just a click! While applying for internships, I often found myself frustrated by having to search for my portfolio, published work, and LinkedIn profile every time. Thatâ€™s when I thought, why not have them all in one convenient place? This inspired the creation of Link List. While it may not be groundbreaking, I am genuinely proud of this project and its potential to make life a bit easier.

## What it does
Link List makes it a breeze to save and access your favorite links with just a click. Enjoy the convenience of easy link copying and a sleek dark mode for comfortable browsing. Plus, with our fun point system, you earn 5 points for every link you add, 3 points per delete, and 1 point for each copy action. Stay organized and engaged with Link List!

## How I built it?
I built Link List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly Chrome extension. The HTML provides the structure of the application, ensuring that elements like buttons, input fields, and lists are properly laid out. CSS is used to style the interface, making it visually appealing with features like dark mode for enhanced usability. JavaScript brings the functionality to life by handling user interactions, such as adding, copying, and deleting links. Additionally, it manages the points system and stores data using Chrome's local storage API.
